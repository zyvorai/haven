## Product at a glance

```text
  Console   →  http://<host>:30742/          (NodePort UI + /api/v1)
  Login     →  http://<host>:30742/login
  Keycloak  →  http://<host>:30180/admin     (typical NodePort)
  Issuer    →  http://<host>:30180/realms/master
  Health    →  GET /api/v1/health
```

Never publish lab IPs — use `<host>`.
